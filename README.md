# Independent-Study-Hands-on-Machine-Learning-

This is a compilation of code that goes along with part 2 of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition that I used to help grasp and understand the content of the book.
I used code that I would copy from the book and then outside resources when I needed help, some of the resources include google, chat gpt, and github repos.
